## System Requirements

- [git](git) v2.13 or greater
- [NodeJS](node) `>=16`
- [npm](npm) v8.16.0 or greater

All of these must be available in your `PATH`. To verify things are set up
properly, you can run this:

```shell
git --version
node --version
npm --version
```
If you have trouble with any of these, learn more about the PATH environment
variable and how to fix it here for [windows][win-path] or
[mac/linux][mac-path].

# Branchs
- main : The deploy branch
- develop : The develop branch
## Demo

Hosted on [magiclogback-production.up.railway.app](https://magiclogback-production.up.railway.app)


## Setup


After you've made sure to have the correct things (and versions) installed, you
should be able to just run a few commands to get set up:

```
cd magicLogFront
npm run install
```
### Prepare environment variables

For sensitive information, which we don't want them checked into git, we inject these configurations to the application as environment variables (even for local environment). Note: we'll likely improve this process in the future.

There's a script that will help you set up the correct environment variables.

1. Copy `.env-example` file and rename into `.env` file. The file `.env` is included in `.gitignore` so the sensitive will not be checked in.

   ```bash
   $ cp .env-example .env
   ```

2. Get the actual values and paste them in `.env`.
   (ask for this file if it's your first time setting this up)

   The `env` file is not a shell execution script, but a shell configuration file. Running the command `source` loads into your **current shell session** with the appropriate environment variables instead of forking another shell session. Once you have this set, launch your IDE or text editor from the shell where the environment variables are set.

## Running the app in dev

To get the app up and running (and really see if it worked), run:
_Only for development purposes_

```shell
npm start:dev
```
## Transpile to typescript

To get the transpiled files run:

```shell
npm run tsx
```
## Running the app in production

To get the app up and running in production :

```shell
npm run tsx
npm run start
```
